# HowFancyAreMyNeighbours
This is a Python Script to check on the Wifi technologies in use around you. I created it because I couldn't see this in another tool and it was a good learning exercise.

Requirements: 
A Wifi card that's able to be put into monitor mode and can talk 802.11ac.
The Airmon suite installed
TShark installed
Python 3 installed


Usage:
python3 ./HowFancyAreMyNeighbours.py [Wifi adaptor]

Tested using ALFA AWUS1900 and Kali Linux 2019.3
